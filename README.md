This project is a simple console-based number guessing game developed to demonstrate the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using a small application. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the user attempts to guess the number within a limited number of attempts.

The project covers the main SDLC phases, including planning, analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
